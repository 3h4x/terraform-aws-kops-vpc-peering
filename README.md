# terraform-aws-kops-vpc-peering [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kops-vpc-peering.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kops-vpc-peering)

Terraform module to create a peering connection between a backing services VPC and a VPC created by [Kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops).

It will lookup the two VPCs by `tag:Name`, and then create a peering connection between them.


## Usage

```hcl
module "kops_vpc_peering" {
  source                    = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kops-vpc-peering.git?ref=master"
  kops_vpc_name             = "us-west-2.prod.cloudposse.com"
  backing_services_vpc_name = "cloudposse-prod-backing-services"
}
```


## Variables

|  Name                         |  Default  |  Description                                                                     | Required |
|:------------------------------|:----------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------:|
| `kops_vpc_name`               | ``        | Kops VPC name                                                                    | Yes      |
| `backing_services_vpc_name`   | ``        | Backing services VPC name                                                        | Yes      |
| `tags`                        | `{}`      | Additional tags  (_e.g._ `map("BusinessUnit","XYZ")`                             | No       |
| `auto_accept`                 | `true`    | Automatically accept the peering (both VPCs need to be in the same AWS account)  | No       |


__NOTE:__ The backing services VPC must have subnets associated with route tables.

__NOTE:__ The DNS resolution feature requires that the backing services VPC must have support for the DNS hostnames enabled.

This can be done by settting the [`enable_dns_hostnames`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/vpc.html#enable_dns_hostnames) attribute to `true`.

|:--------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|
